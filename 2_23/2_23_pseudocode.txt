Want to find out how long it will take for a perturbation of 1k rabits to
propagate to all the other species.

x(n) = A^n * x(0)


epoch

PerturbationVector(extends list)
    get_zero_components
        [i for i, e in enumerate(self) if e ==0]

    update

Trying to get a vector s where si is the smallest number of epochs for which species i is perturbed.

initialize each element of s to equal -1.

We need to simulate the propogation of the perturbation by repeatedly multiplying x by A. After each epoch is simulated,
look at each element of x

After the end-of-epoch value of x has been calculated run these checks:

    If an element of x is non-zero and the same element of s is still negative one, 
        Set that element of s to the current epoch

    If the current epoch is equal to the maximum number of epochs to simulate
        End

    If none of the elements of s is -1, 
        End


Initialize epochs_until_perturbation with -1 for each element
create new perturbation vector(initial perturbation)

while(true)

    perturbation_vector.check_for_newly_perturbed_species()
    
    # If there are no more unperturbed species
    if !perturbation_vector.species_list.check_for_unperturbed_species()
        break

    perturbation_vector.propagate()
    
    If perturbation_vector.epoch is equal to maximum number of epochs to simulate
        break
